# Interview Questions
I did not like my performance during interview.
So I thought I would answer them with real code.
This took about 40 minutes to do.


I cover:
- go.mod
- Testing ( testify)


q01 - runes
The testing file is failing.  I know whats wrong but kind of tired.

q002 - Swap Number int
I was always thinking of using reflect package....   but when Bhanu said "swap", It made me think of something else.
But after reflection, I think he meant to say reflection.swapper.
So that is what I am doing in this demo.
With testing


OpenID V SAML
no examples
LDAP


q03  and q04 - "Spawn" 
I am pretty sure Bhanu was talking about goroutines.
but that is rather complicated.
I did two versions using goroutines, wg and channels.
q03 is testing
But I am not sure how to test go routines other than confirming nothing crashes.

TODO NEXT
1. fix the q01 rune testing.
2. think of another test for q03 and q04.
3. Dockerize it.
4. Add a CICD pipeline for GH actions ( very similar to jenkins) that runs unit testing.
